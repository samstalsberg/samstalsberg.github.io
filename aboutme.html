	<p class="aboutmebio">Hi! I'm Sam, a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and currently living in Madison. I’m passionate about music, movies, and sports, and I love spending time with friends. After graduation, I plan to travel as much as possible before moving to a big city to start my career in marketing or a related field. I value creativity and personal growth, and I’m always looking for new experiences that challenge me and help me grow. Excited for what’s next!</p>
	<p class="aboutmebio">I’m a huge fan of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Green Bay Packers, and I love going to games whenever I can. I also enjoy playing basketball and golf, and I’m always up for a game of pickup or a round of 18. I’m a big music fan, and I love going to concerts and discovering new artists. I’m always looking for new music recommendations, so feel free to send me your favorites!</p>
